## Description

## Installation
You must ensure to have the Node modules installed, along with npm. To run the app invoice the JavaScrip index file using node.

## Usage
This app is best used for the highperforming developper who needs to make professional readme files on the fly. Just run the app and start typing and interactin in the terminal, et voila!

## Test
In the future, I will go the extra mile and write tests for this application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

We haven't implemented the test features yet, eventhough it is best practice to start development with first writing the test cases.Not withstanding, if you would like to share your test methods, feel free to get in touch with us via:
