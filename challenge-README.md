# 09-README-Generator-NodeJS

## Description

In this week's Challenge I created a command-line application to automatically generate professional README files from a template and user input using node modules, npm, and inquirer. 

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## My Work

09-README-Generator-NodeJS 

### Description:
In this week's Challenge I created a command-line application to automatically generate professional README files from a template and user input using node modules, npm, and inquirer.

### Installation:
You must ensure to have the Node modules installed, along with npm. To run the app invoice the JavaScrip index file using node.

### Usage:
This app is best used for the highperforming developper who needs to make professional readme files on the fly. Just run the app and start typing and interactin in the terminal, et voila!

### Tests:
In the future, I will go the extra mile and write tests for this application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
